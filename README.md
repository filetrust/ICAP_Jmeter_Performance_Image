## Troubleshooting

### Shell Script Line Endings
Currently we have a known issue with the shell script 'script.sh'. When you clone this repo the script will have windows compatible line endings (CR LF)
These need to be changed to linux compatible line endings (LF) in order for the script to be run in the linux environment.
There is a simple work around for this

1. After you have cloned the repo open the script.sh file in notepad++
2. To check the line endings see the bottom right hand corner of the window. (There is a box displaying the current line ending format)
3. If this says Windows (CR LF) use the right mouse click on this box. A drop down list will appear
4. Select the option Unix (LF)
5. Save the file

or alternatively you can install ```sudo apt-get install dos2unix``` and run ```dos2unix -n file.txt output.txt``

You will now be able to execute this shell script in the linux environment and should see no errors from executing the jmx script on running the build command
